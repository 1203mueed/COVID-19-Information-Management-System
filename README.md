# COVID-19-Information-Management-System
I did this project in my second semester of the OOP course. Since it was the COVID-19 pandemic, the project idea was related to that scenario. I've used Java Swing for GUI.

Please run the "MainMenu" JFrame to check the project. For admin login, username: admin; password: admin123
You can check other usernames and passwords from Hospital And Diagnostic Center files. The first two lines 
are username and password.
